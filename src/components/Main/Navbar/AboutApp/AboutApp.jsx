              Click on the sound names to hear an example of the sound you want to program. In order to program the
              sound on the grid, just go to the lane of the sound and click on the grid square location where you would
              like to program the selected sound.
            </p>
            <p>This will automatically program the sound and will play at that location. </p>
            <br />

              If you want to save your pattern, click on the SAVE button. You will need to login (or create an account)
              to save your pattern. The app will allow you to do that from there as well.
            </p>
            <p>You can store up to 5 patterns in your account.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              You can manage your saved patterns through MY PATTERNS, where you can load your saved pattern or delete
              one.
            </p>

            <p>You can manage your profile via PROFILE where you can rename your account or change your password.</p>

            <p>I would like to thank everyone who was involved into making this little app. This includes the fantastic teachers of the
              bootcamp (Thanks Jorg, Lloyd & Rana!), my classmates of the course who are all amazing people, my friends who helped me test this app, 
              and my wife who had to endure all my crazyness and code-speak these past months üôà Te quiero ‚ù§Ô∏è
