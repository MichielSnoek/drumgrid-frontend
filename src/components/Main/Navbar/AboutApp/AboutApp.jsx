              Click on the sound names to hear an example of the sound you want to program. Then just click on a square

              If you want to save your pattern, click on the SAVE button. You will need to login (or create an account)
              to save your pattern. The app will allow you to do that from there as well.

              You can manage your saved patterns through MY PATTERNS, where you can load your saved pattern or delete
              one.

              I would like to thank everyone who was involved in making this little app. This includes the fantastic
              teachers of the bootcamp (thanks Jorg, Lloyd & Rana!), my classmates who are all amazing people, my
              friends who helped me break this app enough times for it to work, and my wife Nadia who helped me a lot
              with the design and who had to endure me and my code-speak during these past months{" "}
